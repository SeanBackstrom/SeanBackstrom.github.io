title: About me
subtitle: From Art and Rap to Data and Math
---

  Since 2015 I have been here and there across the U.S. as a full time professional music producer. It has been an interesting ride full of unforgettable moments in front of studio microphones and concert crowds, and has left me with a one-of-a-kind skillset. 

### So why data science?

  Believe it or not, it isn't much of a jump for me. My role in the music world was doing all of the "that's too technical for  me" tasks that artists and record label managers would rather hand off in exchange for a guitar. I was a do-it-all guy, from setting up complex studio and live audio gear through complex routing and electronic systems, to using technical software and audio manipulation techniques to take care of the tasks most artists would rather pay the nerds like me to take care of. 
  
  I was the the guy at the back of the stage behind a soundboard, and the dude hunched in front of a computer in the studio. When the sessions were over and the concerts dispersed, the artists went to party and I went home to code video games, read history books, and plan my next D&D session.

Music is fun, and so is art, but deep in me is a passion to create and participate in valuable work that can impact the real world. 
**Therefore, it's time for me to pivot,** and entering the world of data science is the perfect application for my love of mathematics, and my ingrained creativity.
