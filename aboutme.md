Huh, how did I get here?

Since 2015 I have been here and there across the U.S. as a full time professional music producer. It has been a crazy ride full of zany characters and unforgettable moments in front of studio microphones and concert crowds. 

So why data science?

Believe it or not it isn't that much of a jump for me. As the role of the 'producer' in the various musical settings, what I did best was all the "that's too technical for  me" tasks of the music creating process. From setting up complex studio and live audio gear through complex routing and electronic systems for big concerts and important recording sessions, to using extremely technical software and audio manipulation techniques to take care of the tasks most artists would rather pay the nerds like me to take care of. When the sessions were over and the concerts dispersed, the artists went to party and I went home to code video games and listen to history books.


### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
