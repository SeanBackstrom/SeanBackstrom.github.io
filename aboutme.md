title: About me
subtitle: From Art and Rap to Data and Math
---

  Since 2015 I have been here and there across the U.S. as a full time professional music producer. It has been an interesting ride full of unforgettable moments in front of studio microphones and concert crowds, and has left me with a one-of-a-kind skillset. 

### So why data science?

Believe it or not, it isn't much of a jump for me. My true role was doing all of the "that's too technical for  me" tasks of the music creating process. I have been the go-to guy for artists and record label managers as a sort of do-it-all guy for the 'nerdy' tasks an artist would rather hand off in exchange for a guitar. From setting up complex studio and live audio gear through complex routing and electronic systems, to using technical software and audio manipulation techniques to take care of the tasks most artists would rather pay the nerds like me to take care of. I was the soundboard guy at the concert, and the dude hunched in front of a computer in the studio. When the sessions were over and the concerts dispersed, the artists went to party and I went home to code video games, listen to history books, and plan my next D&D session.

Music is fun, and so is art, but deep in me is a passion to create and participate in valuable work that can impact the real world. 
**Therefore, it's time for me to pivot,** and entering the world of data science is the perfect application for my love of mathematics, and my ingrained creativity.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
