  It's no secret that when Rome overwent the transition from a republic to a dictatorshi- *ahem* I mean empire; that things didn't go exactly seamless. Augustus, the first and probably the best Emperor of Rome, had himself a long 40 year reign with his loyal wife and best friend Agrippa, and died an old man. But as we will find out, that was just beginners luck.

  I will be exploring the data on the first 68 Roman Emperors between 0-400 AD, the many methods they came about, and its relation to how they kicked the bucket.

## How did a Romans method to obtaining power affect their lifespan as Emperor?



  After Augustus's death in 14 AD, the reigns to the biggest land owning empire in the world was passed around to whichever man showed up with the most grizzled men with swords to the capital, or to whoever could sneak the vial of mercury into the pudding, or even to whomever could pay the emperors personal guard enough money to trip onto the emperor with their sword out. Am I just being dramatic? Well yeah, but I got a graph too.

**Crazy right?** That means when you get the illustrious title of most powerful man in the world you have a whopping **69%** chance of dying a violent and early death. Roman Emperor Caracalla was stabbed to death while urinating on the side of the road in 217 AD. a Persian ruler poured molten gold down Roman Emperor Valerian's throat in 260 AD (They must've seen that episode too!). Emperor Commodus (Yes, the one in Gladiator) was actually strangled to death by his wrestling partner in 192 AD. Ok, I'm distracted now, what am I getting at?

## When you kill your way to the throne, you've got about 5 years to enjoy it.

Is that true? Well yeah, on average. I categorized all the Emperors claim to power and averaged the length of reign they got to enjoy. Here's another graph.

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |

| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
