It's no secret that when Rome overwent the transition from a republic to a dictatorshi- *ahem* I mean empire; that things didn't go exactly seamless. Augustus, the first and probably best emperor of Rome, had himself a long 40 year reign with his loyal wife and best friend Agrippa, and died an old man. But as we will find out, that was just beginners luck. I will be exploring the data on the first 68 Roman emperors between 0-400 AD, the many methods they came about, and its relation to how they kicked the bucket.

## How did a Roman emperor's method to obtaining power affect their lifespan as Emperor?



After Augustus's death in 14 AD, the reigns to the biggest land owning empire in the world was passed around to whichever man showed up with the most grizzled men with swords to the capital, or to whoever could sneak the vial of mercury into the pudding, or even to whomever could pay the emperors personal guard enough money to trip onto the emperor with their sword out. Am I just being dramatic? Well yeah, but I got a graph too.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
