  While barreling through my data science projects I've been having moments thinking to myself, how on earth is this algorithm really doing this?
  I mean I know the concepts and general theory behind them, or perhaps an analogy that makes sense for when to use what algorithm, but after one trip into the source
  code of a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm, I knew I knew just about nothing. 
  Hence, this project was born out of my desire to know a little bit more about what is going on under the hood of the algorithms we are blessed to get to write in with a few lines of code.
  
  
  I can only imagine what Apple's Siri algorithm might look like if it was written out mathematically.
  


  After Augustus's death in 14 AD, the reigns to the biggest land owning empire in the world was passed around to whichever man showed up with the most grizzled men with swords to the capital, or to whoever could sneak the vial of mercury into the pudding, or even to whomever could pay the emperors personal guard enough money to trip onto the emperor with their sword out. Am I just being dramatic? Well yeah, but I got a graph too.
